This app is written as a journaling application that allows users to journal with ease. We use [Vader Sentimant Analysis](https://github.com/vaderSentiment/vaderSentiment-js) to determine the positivity of a set of words with emoji support. Here, we put a front and back-end onto it. This allows for the user to write a short blurb, then we'll log whether the users experience was positive or negative. This data is later mapped into a calendar view with the association of +, - or neutrla (defined by red or green or grey) indicators. 

### Emoticon Support
Emoticons are a great quick indicator of whether someone had a good or bad day. By using Vader, sentimant of these icons is possible. This allows us to determine of the user has had either a good or bad experience.

### Extensible API
This api will be available to the public in the future for other applications to use our stable backbone.
